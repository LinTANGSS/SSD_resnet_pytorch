# SSD_resnet_pytorch
## Introduction
This is the SSD model based on the unfinished project by [Max DeGroot](https://github.com/amdegroot/ssd.pytorch/). I have corrected some bugs in the code and successfully run the code on GPU (Tesla P4) at Google Cloud.  

## TODO
I have accumulated the following to-do list, which I hope to complete in the near future
- Still to come:
  * [ ] Support for resNet and mobileNet as feature extractor
  * [ ] Support for SSD512 training and testing
